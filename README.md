# LaTeX Template for for the Journal of Fair Replication Studies

This repository contains a LaTeX template for the Journal of Fair Replication Studies.

## Usage

To use the template, clone the repository and open the `draft.qmd` file in RStudio/VS Code. You can also open the `draft.tex` file in any LaTeX editor, but the Quarto template is recommended to avoid doing copy and paste of the results.

If you need to add more packages to the template, you can do so by adding them to the "Add additional packages" section.

Do not set `ready-to-publish` to `true`, it is a command to enable specific fonts for the final version of the paper.
